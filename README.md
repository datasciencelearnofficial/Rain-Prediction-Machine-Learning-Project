Rain Prediction Machine Learning Project Using Decision Trees and Random Forest 👇 

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python based Machine Learning Model to predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

👩🏻‍💻 Work Process:
1. Importing the preprocessed datasets for training, validation, and testing, where the following data preparation steps have been performed:
 || Splitting a dataset into training, validation & test sets
 || Filling/imputing missing values in numeric columns
 || Scaling numeric features to a (0,1) range
 || Encoding categorical columns as one-hot vectors
2.  Training and interpreting decision trees
3. Training and interpreting random forests
4. Overfitting & hyperparameter tuning
5. Making predictions on single inputs
6. Saving a model to disk
